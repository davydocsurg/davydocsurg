I'm an enthusiastic entrepreneur with years of experience in the tech industry and a freelancer in web design and development. I'm based in Nigeria, I write Php, Javascript and work with Laravel and Vue JS.
More so, I'm mostly self tutored and I believe that I can get any job done notwithstanding the level of difficulty.
